4. Do not add functionality that most UHC players/admins don't use. No kits, no abilities, no supply drops, etc. If you want to add those, fork this plugin and make your own plugin. Do not submit pull requests for these types of additions.
5. Use ur brane pls. Try to follow the general formatting of the existing plugin. 

Pull requests which do not abide by these standards will be ignored until the issues with it are fixed.
