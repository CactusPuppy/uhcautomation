# UHC Automation
## Note: Due to the horribly unoptimal structure of the code, a new rewrite is currently underway and this project will soon be deprecated. Please go to [COMING SOON](https://github.com/uhcmanager/) for the rewrite.
Automates the process of running a UHC or other similarly structured event. For Minecraft Spigot 1.13 (no guarantees that this works on earlier versions) See the [wiki](https://github.com/uhcmanager/uhcautomation/wiki) for usage instructions.

If a 1.12.2 version is needed, see [Release 1.6.1](https://github.com/uhcmanager/uhcautomation/releases/tag/1.6.1). This version is perfectly stable and works without any known bugs, but it will not be receiving any v1.7+ features for now. I'm having enough problems with stabilizng the 1.13 update as is.
