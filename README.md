# UHC Automation
Automates the process of running a UHC or other similarly structured event. For Minecraft Paper 1.13+ (no guarantees that this works on earlier versions). See the [wiki](https://github.com/uhcmanager/uhcautomation/wiki) for usage instructions.

If a legacy version is needed, see [Release 1.6.1](https://github.com/uhcmanager/uhcautomation/releases/tag/1.6.1). This version is perfectly stable and works without any known bugs, but it will not be receiving any v1.7+ features.

## Version 2.0 vs. Version 1.8
Version 2.0 is a complete rewrite aimed at supporting multiple game instances of multiple types at the same time, while also reworking several systems to be less prone to unexpected implicit state-machine bugs. In English, Version 2.0 is better in every possible way.
