# UHC Automation
Automates the process of running a UHC or other similarly structured event. For Minecraft Spigot 1.13 (no guarantees that this works on earlier versions) See the [wiki](https://github.com/CactusPuppy/uhcautomation/wiki) for usage instructions.

If a 1.12.2 version is needed, see [Release 1.6.1](https://github.com/CactusPuppy/uhcautomation/releases/tag/1.6.1). This version is perfectly stable and works without any known bugs, but it will not be receiving any v1.7+ features for now. I'm having enough problems with stabilizng the 1.13 update as is.

Side note: some of my code is probably hot garbage. In the words of Orisa, the horse robot guardian from Overwatch, "I'm still new at this."
