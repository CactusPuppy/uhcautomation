# uhcautomation
Automates the process of running a UHC or other similarly structured event. For Minecraft Spigot 1.12.2 (no guarantees that this works on earlier versions) See the [wiki](https://github.com/CactusPuppy/uhcautomation/wiki) for usage instructions.

NOTES:
- World binding is temporarily uneffective. The UHC will only work in the default world.
